  <div class="caption1"><span class="border2">The scholarship is a grant pay by company, and the company choose which student they gonna give it to. If the student accept the grant, the student will have to work for the company for a certain period
      of time after their graduation. Any company can enter this program, they can find the student by looking at what major does the student take, what grade do they have, what experience they have, and other information about them in school.</span></div>
